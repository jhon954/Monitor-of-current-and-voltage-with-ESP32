# Monitor-of-current-and-voltage-with-ESP32

#### In this project, data is collected with current and voltage sensors in order to monitor energy consumption. The data is processed and sent to Azure IoT Central using an ESP32.

## Table of materials
The materials used are listed in the following table.

| Quantity | Material |
|--------------|--------------|
| 3 | Current sensor SCT013 100Amp   |
| 3 | Voltage sensor    |
| 1 | ESP32 |
| ... |Jumpers or wires|
| 2 | 10K ohm resistor |
| 1 | 30 ohm resistor |
| 1 | 10uF capacitor |

## Electric diagram
The following diagram was prepared with Fritzing, and shows how all components should be connected.
