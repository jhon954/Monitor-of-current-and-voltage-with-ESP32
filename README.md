# Monitor-of-current-and-voltage-with-ESP32

### In this project, voltage and current data taken with sensors is sent to Azure IoT Central using an ESP32.

## The materials used are listed in the following table.

| Cant | Material |
|--------------|--------------|
| 3 | Current sensor SCT013 100Amp   |
| 3 | Voltage sensor    |
| 1 | ESP32 |
| ... |Jumpers or wires|
| 2 | 10K ohm resistor |
| 1 | 30 ohm resistor |
| 1 | 10uF capacitor |
